# Classifying the SVHN Dataset with Faster R-CNN
The goal of this project is to train a Faster R-CNN model with the SVHN dataset and finally to compare the results with the YOLO model trained on the same dataset which is found [here](http://localhost)

## Notes
- Data files removed due to size. The assumption is that the dataset is located in the "data" folder in the main directory.
- Region Proposal Network (RPN) implemented mostly along the lines of the original paper found [here](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5638-faster-r-cnn-towards-real-time-object-detection-with-region-proposal-networks.pdf)

# Classifying the SVHN Dataset with Faster R-CNN
The goal of this project is to train a Faster R-CNN model with the SVHN dataset and finally to compare the results with the YOLO model trained on the same dataset which is found [here](http://localhost)

## Notes
- Data files removed due to size. The assumption is that the dataset is located in the "data" folder in the main directory.
